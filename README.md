## Mandatory Ownership Proof (DMI Rule)
Before you deploy, you MUST edit the footer and add your details:

Original:

```html
<p>Crafted with <span>cloud</span> excellence by Pravin Mishra</p>
```

Add this line (example):

```html
<p><strong>Deployed by:</strong> DMI Cohort 2 | Rahul Sharma | Group 4 | Week 1 | 16-01-2026</p>
```
## Footer Implementation

### Features
- Version display (v1.0)
- Dynamic deployment date
- Author attribution

### Date Generation
The deployment date is dynamically generated using JavaScript:

`` javascript
// Format: DD Mon YYYY
document.getElementById('deployDate').innerText = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-GB', { day: '2-digit', month: 'short', year: 'numeric' }) ''

### Files Modified

    index.html - Added footer HTML with dynamic date span including javascript date formatting.


## How It Works

    Footer contains <span id="deploy-date"> placeholder

    Inside the <span> is the JavaScript script which runs when page loads

    Formats current date as "DD Mon YYYY"

    Updates the span element with current date
